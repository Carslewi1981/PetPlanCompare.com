            OUR MISSION

          <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Pet insurance is one of the most important financial decisions a pet owner can make
              — yet the industry has historically been confusing, inconsistent, and exclusionary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Petz Insurance Compare changes that. We aggregate coverage from across the industry, normalize the
              data for easy comparison, and present it transparently — so you can make the best
              decision for your specific pet, budget, and risk tolerance.
            </p>
            <p>
              We cover dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, reptiles, and exotic animals. We believe every
              companion animal deserves access to quality veterinary care, regardless of species.

          <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Our comparison database is maintained by a dedicated research team that reviews
              insurance policy documents, monitors pricing changes, and verifies coverage details
              directly with providers on a rolling basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you filter by animal type, price, or coverage parameters, we apply those
              filters in real-time against our normalized dataset. No provider pays to appear
              higher in results — rankings are determined entirely by rating, pricing, and
              relevant coverage for your selected criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you click "Get a Quote" or "Contact", you're directed to the provider's own
              systems. Petz Insurance Compare does not process insurance applications or handle premium payments.
              We are a comparison and education platform only.
